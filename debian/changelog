xcb-util (0.2+git2008030901-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Arnaud Fontaine ]
  * debian/control:
    + Add missing dependencies to libxcb*-dev packages. Closes: #480524.
  * patches:
    + Add icccm_remove_useless_functions patch which removes useless
      function for accessing 'flags' which were also buggy because they
      were returning a 'uint8_t' whereas 'flags' is a 'uint32_t'.
    + Add icccm_fix_incorrect_copy which correctly copies the
      reply value according to its format.
    + Add icccm_fix_incorrect_pointer_usage which fixes
      incorrect pointer usage.
  * debian/copyright:
    + Update copyright years.

  [ Julien Danjou ]
  * Switch to git based packaging
